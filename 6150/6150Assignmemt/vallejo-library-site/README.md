# Vallejo Public Library — Responsive Website

This repository contains a responsive website for the Vallejo Public Library, built from the sitemap and mockups of previous assignments.

## Files
- `index.html` — Homepage  
- `catalog.html` — Catalog page

- `styles.css` — One shared CSS file used by all pages  
- `images/` — All image assets used by the site

## How to View
Open `index.html` in a desktop or mobile browser. Resize the window to see responsive behavior.

## Design & Responsiveness
- Mobile-first CSS  
- Tablet breakpoint: **600px**

- Catalog grid: **1 → 2 → 3** columns across breakpoints  
- Book page: stacked layout on mobile, **two-column** on desktop  
- One CSS file for all pages, as required

## Accessibility & Semantics
